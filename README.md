- 👋 Hi, I’m @HarrietLy. I excelled in Math and Natural Science prior to university, however I made the unconventional ( wrong in hindsight) choice to pursue Finance major ( partly due to my curiosity of learning everything about the society) - which was neither technical nor rigorous as I hoped. After 4 years of working in operation modelling/analytics in various tech companies, it was almost a no brainer for me to pursue software engineering where I can again immerse myself in the rigor of math and logic, forever.
- 👀 I’m interested in software developement, full stack software engineering, any large scale systems ( physical or digital) with many interconnected parts
- 🌱 I’m skilled in JavaScript and Python. I am currently learning React, Express and revising Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool tech projects
- 📫 How to reach me harriet.ly.trang@gmail.com
